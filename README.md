A high-performance REST API built on Cloudflare's Global Edge Network, designed for the Bajaj Full Stack Exam.

Endpoint of the API
```
https://bfhl-fullstack-exam-api-production.devversioncv.workers.dev/bfhl
```
## üåü Features

- **Global Edge Deployment**: Deployed across Cloudflare's worldwide network of 300+ edge locations
- **Exceptional Performance**: p99 latency of 0 milliseconds (worst case)
- **DDoS Protection**: Durable Object-based rate limiting with 2-second cooling period between requests
- **High Concurrency**: Capable of handling 30-40k concurrent requests (even more with globally distributed users)
- **Future-Ready**: Architecture prepared for JWT implementation

### POST /bfhl

Processes an array of data and returns separated numbers, letters, and other information.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "data": ["A", "B", "1", "2", "C", "D", "3", "4"]
}
```
Response:
```
json
{
  "is_success": true,
  "user_id": "john_doe_17091999",
  "email": "john@xyz.com",
  "roll_number": "ABCD123",
  "numbers": ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
  "alphabets": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
  "highest_alphabet": ["D"]
}
```

Test with cURL
```
bash
curl -X POST https://bfhl-fullstack-exam-api-production.devversioncv.workers.dev/bfhl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "data": ["A", "B", "1", "2", "C", "D", "3", "4"]
  }'
```


## üöÄ Performance & Scaling

- **Free Tier Limits**: 100,000 requests/day (Cloudflare Workers free plan)
- **Concurrent Requests**: Practically handles 30,000-40,000 concurrent connections even more if the request distributed worldwide.
- **Global Distribution**: Enhanced performance worldwide due to edge network deployment
- **Zero Cold Starts**: Instant response times across all regions due to V8 isolate based runtime.

## üîí Rate Limiting & Security

- **Durable Object Rate Limiter**: Prevents DDoS attacks effectively
- **Cooling Period**: 2 seconds enforced between requests from same origin
- **Automatic Scaling**: No manual intervention required for traffic spikes
